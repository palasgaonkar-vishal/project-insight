## Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001 | Data Ingestion and Processing | As an operations manager, I want the system to automatically load and process all delivery-related data sources so I can query them without manual data preparation. | The system should automatically ingest CSV files (orders, fleet_logs, warehouse_logs, external_factors, feedback, clients, drivers, warehouses) and create searchable vector embeddings. All data should be processed and ready for querying within 30 seconds of system startup. |
| FR002 | Natural Language Query Interface | As an operations manager, I want to ask questions about delivery failures in plain English so I can quickly understand what's happening without learning complex query syntax. | The system should provide a simple text input interface where users can type questions like "Why were deliveries delayed in Mumbai yesterday?" and receive comprehensive, human-readable responses within 10-20 seconds. |
| FR003 | Multi-Source Data Correlation | As an operations manager, I want the system to automatically connect related data across different sources so I can get a complete picture of delivery issues. | When analyzing a delivery failure, the system should automatically retrieve and correlate data from orders, fleet logs, warehouse logs, external factors, and customer feedback to provide comprehensive context and root cause analysis. |
| FR004 | Failure Pattern Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to understand why specific deliveries failed so I can identify recurring problems and take corrective action. | The system should analyze failure patterns by correlating order status, failure reasons, timing, locations, and external factors to provide clear explanations of why failures occurred, including both immediate causes and contributing factors. |
| FR005 | Predictive Failure Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to identify potential failure risks before they happen so I can take preventive measures. | The system should analyze historical patterns and current conditions to predict likely failure scenarios, such as "High risk of delays in Warehouse B due to upcoming weather conditions and historical performance patterns." |
| FR006 | Comparative Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to compare performance across different dimensions (warehouses, cities, time periods) so I can identify best practices and problem areas. | The system should enable comparative queries like "How does Warehouse A compare to Warehouse B?" and provide detailed performance metrics, failure rates, and operational insights with clear recommendations. |
| FR007 | Client-Specific Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to analyze delivery performance for specific clients so I can understand client-specific issues and improve service. | The system should allow queries about specific clients (e.g., "Why did Client X's orders fail in the past week?") and provide client-specific insights including delivery patterns, failure reasons, and recommendations for improvement. |
| FR008 | Geographic Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to understand location-specific delivery challenges so I can optimize operations by region. | The system should enable geographic analysis queries like "Why were deliveries delayed in city X yesterday?" and provide location-specific insights including weather, traffic, infrastructure, and operational factors affecting delivery performance. |
| FR009 | Temporal Analysis | As an operations manager, I want to understand how delivery performance changes over time so I can identify trends and seasonal patterns. | The system should support time-based queries and provide trend analysis showing how failure rates, delivery times, and operational metrics change over different time periods (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal). |
| FR010 | Root Cause Identification | As an operations manager, I want to understand the underlying causes of delivery failures so I can implement targeted solutions. | The system should identify and explain root causes of failures by analyzing the sequence of events, correlating multiple data sources, and providing clear explanations of why specific failures occurred, including both direct and indirect contributing factors. |
| FR011 | Actionable Recommendations | As an operations manager, I want to receive specific recommendations for improving delivery performance so I can take concrete action. | The system should provide specific, actionable recommendations based on analysis results, such as "Increase staffing at Warehouse B during peak hours" or "Implement address verification for deliveries in Mumbai due to high address-related failures." |
| FR012 | Data Source Integration | As an operations manager, I want the system to seamlessly integrate all available data sources so I can get comprehensive insights without missing important context. | The system should automatically integrate and correlate data from orders, fleet logs, warehouse logs, external factors, customer feedback, client information, driver data, and warehouse information to provide complete context for any analysis. |
| FR013 | Query History and Context | As an operations manager, I want to see my previous queries and their results so I can build upon previous analysis and maintain context. | The system should maintain a history of queries and responses, allowing users to reference previous analyses and build upon them. This should include the ability to ask follow-up questions that reference previous queries. |
| FR014 | Response Accuracy and Reliability | As an operations manager, I want to trust that the system's analysis is accurate and based on actual data so I can make informed decisions. | The system should provide responses that are grounded in actual data, with clear indication of data sources used, confidence levels, and the ability to trace back to specific records when needed. Responses should be factually accurate and logically sound. |
| FR015 | Error Handling and Graceful Degradation | As an operations manager, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback when queries cannot be processed. | The system should handle various error conditions (invalid queries, missing data, API failures) gracefully and provide clear, helpful error messages. When partial data is available, it should provide the best possible analysis with clear limitations noted. |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| Requirement ID | Description | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NFR001 | Response Time | The system should provide responses to complex queries within 10-20 seconds, including LLM API calls. Simple queries should respond within 5-10 seconds. |
| NFR002 | Data Processing Speed | The system should process and vectorize all test data (approximately 50,000 records across 8 CSV files) within 30 seconds of startup. |
| NFR003 | Local Deployment | The system should run entirely on a local machine without requiring external services beyond LLM API access. |
| NFR004 | Memory Efficiency | The system should operate efficiently with the available test data without requiring excessive memory or computational resources. |
| NFR005 | Query Complexity Support | The system should handle complex, multi-dimensional queries that require correlation across multiple data sources and temporal analysis. |
| NFR006 | Data Accuracy | The system should maintain data integrity and provide accurate analysis based on the actual data provided, with clear indication of data sources used. |
| NFR007 | User Interface Simplicity | The interface should be simple and intuitive, requiring no training for basic usage. Users should be able to start querying immediately. |
| NFR008 | Scalability for POC | The system should be designed to handle the current test data scale efficiently while being architected to potentially scale to larger datasets in the future. |
