# Task Implementation Guide

## Overview
This folder contains the detailed task breakdown for implementing the AI-Powered Delivery Failure Analysis POC system. Each task is designed to be implemented and tested independently, allowing for incremental development and validation.

## Task Structure

### Task Files
- `task-01-data-foundation.md` - Data loading and validation
- `task-02-vector-database.md` - Vector database setup and embeddings
- `task-03-basic-rag.md` - Core RAG functionality
- `task-04-multi-source-correlation.md` - Advanced data correlation
- `task-05-advanced-query-processing.md` - Sophisticated query processing
- `task-06-user-interface.md` - Web interface and integration

### Progress Tracking
- `progress.md` - Detailed progress tracking and status updates

## Implementation Order

The tasks are designed to be implemented in sequence, with each task building upon the previous ones:

1. **Task 1**: Data Foundation Setup (No dependencies)
2. **Task 2**: Vector Database Setup (Depends on Task 1)
3. **Task 3**: Basic RAG Engine (Depends on Tasks 1-2)
4. **Task 4**: Multi-Source Correlation (Depends on Tasks 1-3)
5. **Task 5**: Advanced Query Processing (Depends on Tasks 1-4)
6. **Task 6**: User Interface and Integration (Depends on All Tasks)

## Development Approach

### Incremental Development
- Each task is self-contained and testable
- Code is run and validated after each task
- Issues are identified and resolved early
- Progress is tracked continuously

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing for individual components
- Integration testing after each task
- End-to-end testing with sample queries
- Performance validation within time constraints

### Quality Assurance
- Code review after each task
- Documentation updates
- Error handling implementation
- User experience validation

## Success Criteria

Each task has specific success criteria that must be met before proceeding to the next task:

1. **Task 1**: All CSV files load successfully with validation
2. **Task 2**: Vector database operational with semantic search
3. **Task 3**: Basic RAG queries return relevant responses
4. **Task 4**: Multi-source data correlation works correctly
5. **Task 5**: Advanced queries are processed accurately
6. **Task 6**: Complete POC system is functional and user-friendly

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement caching and batch processing
- **Data Quality Issues**: Validate data during ingestion
- **Performance Issues**: Optimize vector search and caching
- **Integration Problems**: Test components individually first

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to task requirements
- **Technical Blockers**: Have fallback solutions ready
- **Quality Issues**: Test thoroughly after each task

## Getting Started

1. **Review Task 1**: Read `task-01-data-foundation.md` thoroughly
2. **Set up Environment**: Install required dependencies
3. **Implement Task 1**: Follow the implementation details
4. **Test and Validate**: Ensure success criteria are met
5. **Update Progress**: Mark task as completed in `progress.md`
6. **Move to Next Task**: Proceed to Task 2

## Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Follow the file structure specified in each task
- Use clear, descriptive variable and function names
- Add comprehensive comments and docstrings
- Implement proper error handling

### Testing
- Test each component as you build it
- Use sample data for validation
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Validate performance requirements

### Documentation
- Update progress after each task
- Document any issues or deviations
- Keep notes on learnings and improvements
- Maintain clear task status

## Support and Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Data Loading Errors**: Check file paths and formats
- **API Issues**: Verify API keys and rate limits
- **Performance Problems**: Optimize queries and caching
- **Integration Issues**: Test components individually

### Getting Help
- Review task requirements carefully
- Check error messages and logs
- Test with smaller datasets first
- Document issues for future reference
