# Task 4: Multi-Source Data Correlation

## Objective
Implement advanced data correlation capabilities that can connect related data across different sources (orders, fleet logs, warehouse logs, external factors, feedback) to provide comprehensive analysis.

## Scope
- Create relationship mapping between data sources
- Implement temporal correlation (time-based linking)
- Add geographic correlation (location-based linking)
- Create causal correlation (event sequence analysis)

## Technical Requirements
- Map relationships between data sources using foreign keys
- Implement temporal alignment for time-based queries
- Add geographic clustering for location-based analysis
- Create event sequence analysis for causal relationships

## Implementation Details
- **File**: `src/correlation_engine.py`
- **Dependencies**: pandas, numpy, scipy
- **Relationships**: order_id, client_id, driver_id, warehouse_id
- **Temporal**: Align timestamps across different sources
- **Geographic**: Cluster by city, state, pincode

## Success Criteria
- Data sources are properly correlated using relationships
- Temporal queries work across multiple sources
- Geographic analysis provides location-based insights
- Causal analysis identifies event sequences

## Testing
- Test relationship mapping between sources
- Verify temporal correlation with time-based queries
- Test geographic analysis with location queries
- Validate causal analysis with event sequence queries

## Estimated Time
4-5 hours

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Data Foundation Setup
- Task 2: Vector Database Setup
- Task 3: Basic RAG Engine

## Next Task
Task 5: Advanced Query Processing
