# Task 1: Streaming-First Data Foundation Setup

## Objective
Set up a production-ready data ingestion pipeline using streaming processing that can handle large datasets efficiently while maintaining memory efficiency and scalability.

## Scope
- Implement streaming data processing for all 8 data sources
- Set up SQLite database with proper schema and indexing
- Create chunked data validation and error handling
- Implement data pagination and caching mechanisms
- Add data statistics and monitoring capabilities

## Technical Requirements
- Process all CSV files using streaming: orders, fleet_logs, warehouse_logs, external_factors, feedback, clients, drivers, warehouses
- Create SQLite database with optimized schema and indexes
- Implement chunked processing (default: 1000 records per chunk)
- Add data validation for required fields with error reporting
- Create data pagination and lazy loading capabilities
- Implement basic caching for frequently accessed data
- Add memory usage monitoring and optimization

## Implementation Details
- **File**: `src/data_foundation.py`
- **Dependencies**: pandas, sqlite3, pydantic, psutil (memory monitoring)
- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema and indexing
- **Processing**: Chunked streaming with configurable chunk size
- **Caching**: In-memory LRU cache for frequently accessed data
- **Output**: Database-stored data with streaming access methods

## Database Schema Design
```sql
-- Orders table with optimized indexing
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    client_id INTEGER,
    customer_name TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    order_date TIMESTAMP,
    status TEXT,
    failure_reason TEXT,
    -- ... other fields
    INDEX idx_client_id (client_id),
    INDEX idx_city_state (city, state),
    INDEX idx_order_date (order_date),
    INDEX idx_status (status)
);

-- Similar optimized schemas for all 8 data sources
```

## Success Criteria
- All 8 CSV files process successfully using streaming without memory issues
- Database stores all data with proper indexing and relationships
- Data validation passes for all required fields with detailed error reporting
- Pagination works efficiently for large datasets (test with 10x data size)
- Memory usage remains constant regardless of data size
- Data can be accessed programmatically through streaming interfaces
- System can handle data 10x larger than test data without performance degradation

## Testing
- Test streaming processing with different chunk sizes
- Verify database storage and indexing performance
- Test pagination with large datasets
- Validate memory usage remains constant
- Test data validation with malformed data
- Verify error handling and reporting

## Performance Requirements
- Process 10,000 records in under 30 seconds
- Memory usage should not exceed 500MB regardless of data size
- Database queries should return results in under 1 second
- System should handle 100,000+ records without issues

## Estimated Time
4-5 hours (increased due to streaming complexity)

## Dependencies
None (first task)

## Next Task
Task 2: Vector Database Setup
