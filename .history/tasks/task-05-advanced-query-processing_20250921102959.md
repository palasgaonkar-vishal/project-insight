# Task 5: Advanced Query Processing

## Objective
Implement sophisticated query processing capabilities that can handle complex, multi-dimensional queries and provide intelligent analysis with actionable recommendations.

## Scope
- Create advanced query parsing and intent classification
- Implement pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Add predictive analysis capabilities
- Create recommendation generation system

## Technical Requirements
- Advanced NLP for query understanding
- Pattern recognition algorithms for failure analysis
- Predictive modeling for risk assessment
- Recommendation engine for actionable insights

## Implementation Details
- **File**: `src/advanced_processor.py`
- **Dependencies**: scikit-learn, nltk, transformers
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring failure patterns
- **Predictive Analysis**: Forecast potential issues
- **Recommendations**: Generate actionable suggestions

## Success Criteria
- Complex queries are parsed and understood correctly
- Pattern recognition identifies recurring issues
- Predictive analysis provides risk assessments
- Recommendations are specific and actionable

## Testing
- Test with complex queries from the original requirements
- Verify pattern recognition with known failure patterns
- Test predictive analysis with historical data
- Validate recommendation quality and specificity

## Estimated Time
5-6 hours

## Dependencies
- Task 1: Data Foundation Setup
- Task 2: Vector Database Setup
- Task 3: Basic RAG Engine
- Task 4: Multi-Source Correlation

## Next Task
Task 6: User Interface and Integration
